# WebSh
This is a web browser for the linux terminals! You do not have to install anything (mabye sh) the setup installs it all!
It is very simple to recode this it is only 6 lines of code!!!!
Also! This is a beta more things will be added (like javascript)
And thanks for looking at this project if you are on Windows just use WSL
